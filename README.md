📝 Description
         This project simulates and analyzes electricity consumption data for 20 apartments over a 30-day period using Python. It includes data generation, cleaning, exploration, visualization, and anomaly detection to understand usage trends and identify unusually high consumption.

📌 Features
       Simulates realistic electricity usage data using NumPy.
       Aggregates total usage per apartment.
       Analyzes daily average consumption.
       Visualizes results using bar and line charts (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
       Flags apartments/days with unusually high usage using statistical thresholds.

🛠️ Technologies Used
       Python
       NumPy
       Pandas
       Matplotlib
       Seaborn

📊 Visualizations
       Bar Chart: Total usage per apartment.
       Line Chart: Daily average usage across all apartments.
       Anomaly Detection: Apartments with usage above mean + 2×std are flagged.
