📝 Description : 
         This project simulates and analyzes electricity consumption data for 20 apartments over a 30-day period using Python. It includes data generation, cleaning, exploration, visualization, and anomaly detection to understand usage trends and identify unusually high consumption.

📌 Features : 
       1.Simulates realistic electricity usage data using NumPy.
       2.Aggregates total usage per apartment.
       3.Analyzes daily average consumption.
       4.Visualizes results using bar and line charts (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
       5.Flags apartments/days with unusually high usage using statistical thresholds.

🛠️ Technologies Used
       1.Python
       2.NumPy
       3.Pandas
       4.Matplotlib
       5.Seaborn

📊 Visualizations
       1.Bar Chart: Total usage per apartment.
       2.Line Chart: Daily average usage across all apartments.
       3.Anomaly Detection: Apartments with usage above mean + 2×std are flagged.
